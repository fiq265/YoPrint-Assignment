## About Assignment

This system enables users to upload CSV files that are processed in the background with real-time status updates. It ensures clean, duplicate-free, and consistently updated data through idempotent uploads and UPSERT logic. Users can view their upload history, receive completion notifications, and rely on a seamless, reliable file-processing workflow.

- The assignment is built using Laravel 12.
- MySQL is used as the default database connection.
- Redis is configured as the queue connection.
- Database migrations are used to create the required tables.
